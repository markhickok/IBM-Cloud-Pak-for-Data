There are several additional options available on the right. One of those is 'Enforce data protection rules'. If selected, that is the permanent decision which will be enforced on the catalog forever.

In the Collaborators line start typing user name and when goal one is found select it with the mouse click
Also assing the proper role to this user: Admin, Editor or Viewer. For the 'Data Steward' I selected the Viewer role in order to demonstrate later on the Data Protection rules functinality.
