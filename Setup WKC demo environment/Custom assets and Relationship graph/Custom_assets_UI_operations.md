# Why we need custom assets

I've recently received one of the questions from existing Information Server - Infosphere Governance Catalog client if they can switch to CP4D IKC with few important features of their current install to be still available after migration. The original question was if the following relathionship visualization they have in IGC could be migrated to IKC

That relationship diagram allows to demonstrate the connections between different types of governance artifacts with results of metadata import and, what's important, also with custom assets you could previously configure via 'bundles' in IGC.

# Pre-requisites

To run this demo you would need:

1. CP4D v4.8.3 or later
2. IKC service with administative privileges
3. if before CP4D v5 the Beta Relationship explorer feature on the IKC governance UI and Catalog portal should be enabled

# Custom asset creation sample

Open 'Administration - Governance and Catalogs' from main menu

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-1.png)

Select 'Asset and Artifact definitions'

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-2.png)

In the left menu switch to 'Assets' and the press 'New asset type' blue button on the right side.

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-3.png)

Name it Custom tag asset, the unique identifier is generated by default, you may keep that as is.

Description is optional. Let's fill that in as "Custom tag asset for the demo"

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-4.png)

Press 'Create' button at the end.

When done, you may customize the attributes from which your asset consists of.

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-5.png)

There are plenty of attributes already there by default, but let's pretend we need anohter one custom.

On the line of 'Details' open 'Add' button and select 'New property'

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-6.png)

Create property with the Name 'Global standard value'. Select the Property type from the list as 'Predefined values'. This will allow you to create a drop-down list for the user to select values from restricting the value to only limited list. This may be the rule from governance organization for specific types, standards, regulation related requirements.

Scroll down and start filling in the values.

Value: Standard 1

Description: This is a Standard 1 value for the tag

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-8.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Press Create button which is right below the Description field - NOT the blue one at the right botton corner

Same way create the second Value for the list.

Value: Standard 2

Description: This is a Standard 2 value for the tag

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Again press Create button which is right below the Description field - NOT the blue one at the right botton corner

Now you may press the blue 'Create' button

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-9.png)

You will now see the added property in the list of all Custom tag asset attributes

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-10.png)

Switch to Enterprise Catalog

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-11.png)

On the right top corner open the 'Add to catalog' drop down and select 'Custom asset'

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-12.png)

In the new window provide the:

Asset name: My new tag

Select the Type from drop down which you've created on previous steps - 'Custom tag asset'

Description: This is My new tag asset of Custom tag asset type

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-13.png)

Press blue 'Create' button at the bottom

On the page of newly created asset with your name, edit the property values. E.g. Select 'Standard 1' for the Global standard value.

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-14.png)

I've also added the relationship to 'Customer' business term and 'my_customer' table which I used in privious demo scenarios.

Now press Explore Relationship button at the top

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-15.png)

If all done according to instructions for WKC demo setup guide and this file, then the result graph on Relationship explorer will be very similar to what's on the screenshot below.

![alt text](/Setup%20WKC%20demo%20environment/Custom%20assets%20and%20Relationship%20graph/images/custom_assets-16.png)

This concludes the Custom Assets and Relationship Graph section.
