# IKC demo setup guide

## Introduction

This github section provides the sample steps and guides to setup the basic demo on IBM CP4D

## Disclaimers

- All the guide sections are created using on-premise version of IBM CP4D. In majority of the guide scripts the SaaS instance tuning is either identical or similar, but for some parts of functionality the deviations may happen.
- In most of the guide parts the exact version of the CP4D environment is mentioned. With IBM CP4D solution lifecycle the newer versions may be not 1:1 edentical, but likely to follow same principles and generic guidelines.
