# Provision of the proper credentials to the out of the box Categories

IBM CP4D after standard deployment there are couple of pre-built categories where the sample data classes and reference data sets reside. Those are Locations and uncategorised. Before you can upload the demo content into the service under your own user, this user account should be assigned proper credentials for those existing folders.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> make sure you are logged into UI under the default 'cpadmin' user account
