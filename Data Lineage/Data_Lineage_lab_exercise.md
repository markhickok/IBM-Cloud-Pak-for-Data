# Data lineage HOL

The goal of this HOL is to provide complete set of knowledge and guidelines to setup your own CP4D custom demo of the Metadata lineage with IKC and Manta services from scratch.

To follow this exercise you would complete activites in 4 lab chapters:

[Step 0 - Pre-work scenario](/Data%20Lineage/Lab1_data_lineage_ETL_Postgres_0_pre-work.md)

1.  Objectives
2.  Pre-work
    - Setup the data sources
    - CP4D services used in the lab
    - Setup environment
      - User creation
      - Platform connections creation
    - Creation of Projects and Catalogs
    - IKC and Manta services integration

[Step 1 - Data Pipelines creation scenario](/Data%20Lineage/Lab1_data_lineage_ETL_Postgres_1_Data_Pipelines_creation.md)

3. Connectivity and asset import

   - Import platform connections
   - Perform metadata import for the data assets

4. DataStage flow design
   - Customer data migration
   - Address information transformation and migration

[Step 2 - Lineage metadata import](/Data%20Lineage/Lab1_data_lineage_ETL_Postgres_2_Lineage_metadata_import.md)

5. Lineage metadata import
   - Metadata import of Sources and Targets
   - Metadata import of DataStage ETL pipelines

[Step 3 - Review lineage results](/Data%20Lineage/Lab1_data_lineage_ETL_Postgres_3_Lineage_review.md)

6. Review of lineage analysis
   - CP4D Catalog content review
   - Technical lineage representation for pipeline
   - Lab exercise results, technical lineage
   - Additional technical lineage content available
